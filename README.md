# Overview
This application was created to help me learn the C++ language especial in use of classes. It is a basic calculator that performs basic functionality as a windows form application.
By using the visual studio .NET framework this app was simple to create but had a high learning curve. Careful review of the useful websites is recomended when trying to use this software. If you don't have experience in visual studio these website will help and is recommended to understand the layout and functionality first.

To use this app, simply open visual studio and clone the repository. You can then click the run button in the top menu bar and the application will launch from there. Simply use the application as directed in the demo video below.

# Future Work

- Reorganize classes: I would like to make my classes and button functions more modular. There was probaby a better way to create my classes and use inheritance for my operators and calculating fucntions. 
- Add graphic calculator: With more knowledge of the C++ language it would be useful to add graphing calculator functionality. This would require more classes and a better interface as well.
